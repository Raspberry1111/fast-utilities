# fast-utilities
## A nodejs library of utilities written in rust

### NOTE: This project is very WIP, and despite the name, is not very fast
### I recommend you rather use something like [lodash](https://lodash.com) until this becomes faster/more stable

## Motivation
There are lots of libraries to help abstract away some more annoying tasks like [lodash](https://lodash.com). However, I think the speed of these libraries can be improved upon using web assembly

## Does this replace \<insert library name here\> (ex lodash)
No

1: Other libraries are more trusted and used in commercial applications

2: This is more of an experiment/learning experience for me to see what's possible using web assembly
